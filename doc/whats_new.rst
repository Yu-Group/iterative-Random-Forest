   - The ``min_weight_fraction_leaf`` constraint in tree construction is now
     more efficient, taking a fast path to declare a node a leaf if its weight
     is less than 2 * the minimum. Note that the constructed tree will be
     different from previous versions where ``min_weight_fraction_leaf`` is
     used. (`#7441 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7441>`_)
     by `Nelson Liu`_.

   - Added ``average`` parameter to perform weights averaging in
     :class:`linear_model.PassiveAggressiveClassifier`. (`#4939
     <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4939>`_) by `Andrea
     Esuli`_.

   - Custom metrics for the :mod:`sklearn.neighbors` binary trees now have
     fewer constraints: they must take two 1d-arrays and return a float.
     (`#6288 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/6288>`_) by
     `Jake VanderPlas`_.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`
     now support sparse input for prediction.
     (`#6101 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/6101>`_)
     By `Ibraim Ganiev`_.

   - Added ``shuffle`` and ``random_state`` parameters to shuffle training
     data before taking prefixes of it based on training sizes in
     :func:`model_selection.learning_curve`.
     (`#7506` <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7506>_) by
     `Narine Kokhlikyan`_.

Bug fixes
.........

   - Fix a bug where :class:`sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFdr` did not 
     exactly implement Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. It formerly may have
     selected fewer features than it should.
     (`#7490 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7490>`_) by
     `Peng Meng`_.

     integer inputs
     (`#6282 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/6282>`_) by
     `Jake Vanderplas`_.

   - The ``min_weight_fraction_leaf`` parameter of tree-based classifiers and
     regressors now assumes uniform sample weights by default if the
     ``sample_weight`` argument is not passed to the ``fit`` function.
     Previously, the parameter was silently ignored. (`#7301
     <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7301>`_) by `Nelson

.. _model_selection_changes:

Model Selection Enhancements and API Changes
--------------------------------------------

  - **The model_selection module**

    The new module :mod:`sklearn.model_selection`, which groups together the
    functionalities of formerly :mod:`sklearn.cross_validation`,
    :mod:`sklearn.grid_search` and :mod:`sklearn.learning_curve`, introduces new
    possibilities such as nested cross-validation and better manipulation of
    parameter searches with Pandas.

    Many things will stay the same but there are some key differences. Read
    below to know more about the changes.

  - **Data-independent CV splitters enabling nested cross-validation**

    The new cross-validation splitters, defined in the
    :mod:`sklearn.model_selection`, are no longer initialized with any
    data-dependent parameters such as ``y``. Instead they expose a
    :func:`split` method that takes in the data and yields a generator for the
    different splits.

    This change makes it possible to use the cross-validation splitters to
    perform nested cross-validation, facilitated by
    :class:`model_selection.GridSearchCV` and
    :class:`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV` utilities.

  - **The enhanced cv_results_ attribute**

    The new ``cv_results_`` attribute (of :class:`model_selection.GridSearchCV`
    and :class:`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV`) introduced in lieu of the
    ``grid_scores_`` attribute is a dict of 1D arrays with elements in each
    array corresponding to the parameter settings (i.e. search candidates).

    The ``cv_results_`` dict can be easily imported into ``pandas`` as a
    ``DataFrame`` for exploring the search results.

    The ``cv_results_`` arrays include scores for each cross-validation split
    (with keys such as ``'split0_test_score'``), as well as their mean
    (``'mean_test_score'``) and standard deviation (``'std_test_score'``).

    The ranks for the search candidates (based on their mean
    cross-validation score) is available at ``cv_results_['rank_test_score']``.

    The parameter values for each parameter is stored separately as numpy
    masked object arrays. The value, for that search candidate, is masked if
    the corresponding parameter is not applicable. Additionally a list of all
    the parameter dicts are stored at ``cv_results_['params']``.

  - **Parameters n_folds and n_iter renamed to n_splits**

    Some parameter names have changed:
    The ``n_folds`` parameter in new :class:`model_selection.KFold`,
    :class:`model_selection.GroupKFold` (see below for the name change),
    and :class:`model_selection.StratifiedKFold` is now renamed to
    ``n_splits``. The ``n_iter`` parameter in
    :class:`model_selection.ShuffleSplit`, the new class
    :class:`model_selection.GroupShuffleSplit` and
    :class:`model_selection.StratifiedShuffleSplit` is now renamed to
    ``n_splits``.

  - **Rename of splitter classes which accepts group labels along with data**

    The cross-validation splitters ``LabelKFold``,
    ``LabelShuffleSplit``, ``LeaveOneLabelOut`` and ``LeavePLabelOut`` have
    been renamed to :class:`model_selection.GroupKFold`,
    :class:`model_selection.GroupShuffleSplit`,
    :class:`model_selection.LeaveOneGroupOut` and
    :class:`model_selection.LeavePGroupsOut` respectively.

    Note the change from singular to plural form in
    :class:`model_selection.LeavePGroupsOut`.

  - **Fit parameter labels renamed to groups**

    The ``labels`` parameter in the :func:`split` method of the newly renamed
    splitters :class:`model_selection.GroupKFold`,
    :class:`model_selection.LeaveOneGroupOut`,
    :class:`model_selection.LeavePGroupsOut`,
    :class:`model_selection.GroupShuffleSplit` is renamed to ``groups``
    following the new nomenclature of their class names.

  - **Parameter n_labels renamed to n_groups**

    The parameter ``n_labels`` in the newly renamed
    :class:`model_selection.LeavePGroupsOut` is changed to ``n_groups``.

  - Training scores and Timing information

    ``cv_results_`` also includes the training scores for each
    cross-validation split (with keys such as ``'split0_train_score'``), as
    well as their mean (``'mean_train_score'``) and standard deviation
    (``'std_train_score'``). To avoid the cost of evaluating training score,
    set ``return_train_score=False``.

    Additionally the mean and standard deviation of the times taken to split,
    train and score the model across all the cross-validation splits is
    available at the key ``'mean_time'`` and ``'std_time'`` respectively.

Classifiers and Regressors

   - The Gaussian Process module has been reimplemented and now offers classification
     and regression estimators through :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessClassifier`
     and  :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor`. Among other things, the new
     implementation supports kernel engineering, gradient-based hyperparameter optimization or
     sampling of functions from GP prior and GP posterior. Extensive documentation and
     examples are provided. By `Jan Hendrik Metzen`_.

   - Added new supervised learning algorithm: :ref:`Multi-layer Perceptron <multilayer_perceptron>`
     (`#3204 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3204>`_) by `Issam H. Laradji`_

   - Added :class:`linear_model.HuberRegressor`, a linear model robust to outliers.

     converts single output regressors to multi-ouput regressors by fitting
     one regressor per output. By `Tim Head`_.

Other estimators

   - New :class:`mixture.GaussianMixture` and :class:`mixture.BayesianGaussianMixture`
     replace former mixture models, employing faster inference
     for sounder results.

     `Wei Xue`_ and `Thierry Guillemot`_.

   - Class :class:`decomposition.RandomizedPCA` is now factored into :class:`decomposition.PCA`
     and it is available calling with parameter ``svd_solver='randomized'``.
     The default number of ``n_iter`` for ``'randomized'`` has changed to 4. The old
     behavior of PCA is recovered by ``svd_solver='full'``. An additional solver
     calls ``arpack`` and performs truncated (non-randomized) SVD. By default,
     the best solver is selected depending on the size of the input and the
     number of components requested.
     (`#5299 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/5299>`_) by `Giorgio Patrini`_.

   - Added two functions for mutual information estimation:
     :func:`feature_selection.mutual_info_classif` and
     :func:`feature_selection.mutual_info_regression`. These functions can be
     used in :class:`feature_selection.SelectKBest` and
     :class:`feature_selection.SelectPercentile` as score functions.
     By `Andrea Bravi`_ and `Nikolay Mayorov`_.

   - Added the :class:`ensemble.IsolationForest` class for anomaly detection based on
     random forests. By `Nicolas Goix`_.

   - Added ``algorithm="elkan"`` to :class:`cluster.KMeans` implementing
     Elkan's fast K-Means algorithm. By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

     Index which measures the similarity of two clusterings of a set of points
     By `Arnaud Fouchet`_ and `Thierry Guillemot`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.calinski_harabaz_score`, which computes the Calinski
     and Harabaz score to evaluate the resulting clustering of a set of points.

   - Added new cross-validation splitter
     :class:`model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit` to handle time series data.
     (`#6586
     <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/6586>`_) by `YenChen
     Lin`_

   - The cross-validation iterators are replaced by cross-validation splitters
     available from :mod:`sklearn.model_selection`, allowing for nested
     cross-validation.
     See :ref:`model_selection_changes` for more information.

     consumption.
     (`#6913 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/6913>`_)
     By `YenChen Lin`_.

   - :class:`semi_supervised.LabelPropagation` and :class:`semi_supervised.LabelSpreading`

     (`#7324 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7325>`_)
     By `Eugene Chen`_ and `Raghav R V`_.

Bug fixes
.........

Trees and ensembles

    - Random forest, extra trees, decision trees and gradient boosting
      won't accept anymore ``min_samples_split=1`` as at least 2 samples
      are required to split a decision tree node. By `Arnaud Joly`_

    - :class:`ensemble.VotingClassifier` now raises ``NotFittedError`` if ``predict``,
      ``transform`` or ``predict_proba`` are called on the non-fitted estimator.
      by `Sebastian Raschka`_.

    - Fix bug where :class:`ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier` and
      :class:`ensemble.AdaBoostRegressor` would perform poorly if the
      ``random_state`` was fixed
      (`#7411 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7411>`_).
      By `Joel Nothman`_.

    - Fix bug in ensembles with randomization where the ensemble would not
      set ``random_state`` on base estimators in a pipeline or similar nesting.
      (`#7411 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7411>`_).
      Note, results for :class:`ensemble.BaggingClassifier`
      :class:`ensemble.BaggingRegressor`, :class:`ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier`
      and :class:`ensemble.AdaBoostRegressor` will now differ from previous
      versions. By `Joel Nothman`_.

Linear, kernelized and related models

    - Fixed incorrect gradient computation for ``loss='squared_epsilon_insensitive'`` in
      :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` and :class:`linear_model.SGDRegressor`
      (`#6764 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/6764>`_). By `Wenhua Yang`_.

    - Fix bug in :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` where
      ``solver='liblinear'`` did not accept ``class_weights='balanced``.
      (`#6817 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/6817>`_).
      By `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.

    - Fix bug in :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier` where an error
      occurred when there were outliers being labelled and a weight function
      specified (`#6902
      <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/6902>`_).  By
      `LeonieBorne <https://github.com/LeonieBorne>`_.

    - Fix :class:`linear_model.ElasticNet` sparse decision function to match
      output with dense in the multioutput case.

Decomposition, manifold learning and clustering

    - :class:`decomposition.RandomizedPCA` default number of `iterated_power` is 4 instead of 3.
      (`#5141 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/5141>`_) by `Giorgio Patrini`_.

    - :func:`utils.extmath.randomized_svd` performs 4 power iterations by default, instead or 0.
      In practice this is enough for obtaining a good approximation of the
      true eigenvalues/vectors in the presence of noise. When `n_components` is
      small (``< .1 * min(X.shape)``) `n_iter` is set to 7, unless the user specifies
      a higher number. This improves precision with few components.

      by `Yichuan Liu <https://github.com/yl565>`_.

Metrics

    - Fix bug in :func:`metrics.silhouette_score` in which clusters of
      size 1 were incorrectly scored. They should get a score of 0.
      By `Joel Nothman`_.

    - Fix bug in :func:`metrics.silhouette_samples` so that it now works with
      arbitrary labels, not just those ranging from 0 to n_clusters - 1.

    - Fix bug where expected and adjusted mutual information were incorrect if
      cluster contingency cells exceeded ``2**16``. By `Joel Nothman`_.

    - :func:`utils.extmath.randomized_range_finder` is more numerically stable when many
      power iterations are requested, since it applies LU normalization by default.
      If ``n_iter<2`` numerical issues are unlikely, thus no normalization is applied.
      Other normalization options are available: ``'none', 'LU'`` and ``'QR'``.
      (`#5141 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/5141>`_) by `Giorgio Patrini`_.

**February 18, 2016**

Changelog
---------

Bug fixes
.........


    - Upgrade vendored joblib to version 0.9.4 that fixes an important bug in
      ``joblib.Parallel`` that can silently yield to wrong results when working
      on datasets larger than 1MB:
      https://github.com/joblib/joblib/blob/0.9.4/CHANGES.rst

    - Fixed reading of Bunch pickles generated with scikit-learn
      version <= 0.16. This can affect users who have already
      downloaded a dataset with scikit-learn 0.16 and are loading it
      with scikit-learn 0.17. See `#6196
      <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/6196>`_ for
      how this affected :func:`datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`. By `Loic
      Esteve`_.

    - Fixed a bug that prevented using ROC AUC score to perform grid search on
      several CPU / cores on large arrays. See `#6147
      <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/6147>`_
      By `Olivier Grisel`_.

    - Fixed a bug that prevented to properly set the ``presort`` parameter
      in :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`. See `#5857
      <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/5857>`_
      By Andrew McCulloh.

    - Fixed a joblib error when evaluating the perplexity of a
      :class:`decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation` model. See `#6258
      <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/6258>`_

New features
............

   - All the Scaler classes but :class:`preprocessing.RobustScaler` can be fitted online by
     calling `partial_fit`. By `Giorgio Patrini`_.

   - The new class :class:`ensemble.VotingClassifier` implements a
     "majority rule" / "soft voting" ensemble classifier to combine
     estimators for classification. By `Sebastian Raschka`_.

   - The new class :class:`preprocessing.RobustScaler` provides an
     alternative to :class:`preprocessing.StandardScaler` for feature-wise
     centering and range normalization that is robust to outliers.
     By `Thomas Unterthiner`_.

   - The new class :class:`preprocessing.MaxAbsScaler` provides an
     alternative to :class:`preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` for feature-wise
     range normalization when the data is already centered or sparse.
     By `Thomas Unterthiner`_.

   - The new class :class:`preprocessing.FunctionTransformer` turns a Python
     function into a ``Pipeline``-compatible transformer object.
     By Joe Jevnik.

   - The new classes :class:`cross_validation.LabelKFold` and
     :class:`cross_validation.LabelShuffleSplit` generate train-test folds,
     respectively similar to :class:`cross_validation.KFold` and
     :class:`cross_validation.ShuffleSplit`, except that the folds are
     conditioned on a label array. By `Brian McFee`_, `Jean Kossaifi`_ and
     `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - :class:`decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation` implements the Latent
     Dirichlet Allocation topic model with online  variational
     inference. By `Chyi-Kwei Yau`_, with code based on an implementation
     by Matt Hoffman. (`#3659 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3659>`_)

   - The new solver ``sag`` implements a Stochastic Average Gradient descent
     and is available in both :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` and
     :class:`linear_model.Ridge`. This solver is very efficient for large
     datasets. By `Danny Sullivan`_ and `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.
     (`#4738 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4738>`_)

   - The new solver ``cd`` implements a Coordinate Descent in
     :class:`decomposition.NMF`. Previous solver based on Projected Gradient is
     still available setting new parameter ``solver`` to ``pg``, but is
     deprecated and will be removed in 0.19, along with
     :class:`decomposition.ProjectedGradientNMF` and parameters ``sparseness``,
     ``eta``, ``beta`` and ``nls_max_iter``. New parameters ``alpha`` and
     ``l1_ratio`` control L1 and L2 regularization, and ``shuffle`` adds a
     shuffling step in the ``cd`` solver.
     By `Tom Dupre la Tour`_ and `Mathieu Blondel`_.

     improvements for :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` and
     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`, including options for coloring nodes
     by their majority class or impurity, showing variable names, and using
     node proportions instead of raw sample counts. By `Trevor Stephens`_.

   - Improved speed of ``newton-cg`` solver in
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression`, by avoiding loss computation.
     By `Mathieu Blondel`_ and `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.

   - The ``class_weight="auto"`` heuristic in classifiers supporting

     option, which has a simpler formula and interpretation.
     By Hanna Wallach and `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - Add ``class_weight`` parameter to automatically weight samples by class
     frequency for :class:`linear_model.PassiveAgressiveClassifier`. By

     :func:`sklearn.metrics.recall_score` and
     :func:`sklearn.metrics.precision_score` has been extended.
     It is now possible to ignore one or more labels, such as where
     a multiclass problem has a majority class to ignore. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Add ``sample_weight`` support to :class:`linear_model.RidgeClassifier`.
     By `Trevor Stephens`_.

   - Provide an option for sparse output from

     :func:`sklearn.dataset.load_breast_cancer`.

   - Upgraded to joblib 0.9.3 to benefit from the new automatic batching of
     short tasks. This makes it possible for scikit-learn to benefit from
     parallelism when many very short tasks are executed in parallel, for
     instance by the :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` meta-estimator
     with ``n_jobs > 1`` used with a large grid of parameters on a small
     dataset. By `Vlad Niculae`_, `Olivier Grisel`_ and `Loic Esteve`_.

     (using the ball-tree) by Nikolay Mayorov.

   - Allow :func:`datasets.make_multilabel_classification` to output
     a sparse ``y``. By Kashif Rasul.

   - :class:`cluster.DBSCAN` now accepts a sparse matrix of precomputed
     distances, allowing memory-efficient distance precomputation. By
     `Joel Nothman`_.

   - :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` now exposes an ``apply`` method
     for retrieving the leaf indices samples are predicted as. By
     `Daniel Galvez`_ and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Speed up decision tree regressors, random forest regressors, extra trees
     regressors and gradient boosting estimators by computing a proxy
     of the impurity improvement during the tree growth. The proxy quantity is
     such that the split that maximizes this value also maximizes the impurity
     improvement. By `Arnaud Joly`_, `Jacob Schreiber`_ and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Speed up tree based methods by reducing the number of computations needed
     when computing the impurity measure taking into account linear
     relationship of the computed statistics. The effect is particularly
     visible with extra trees and on datasets with categorical or sparse
     features. By `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` and
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` now expose an ``apply``
     method for retrieving the leaf indices each sample ends up in under
     each try. By `Jacob Schreiber`_.

   - Add ``sample_weight`` support to :class:`linear_model.LinearRegression`.
     By Sonny Hu. (`#4481 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4881>`_)

   - Add ``n_iter_without_progress`` to :class:`manifold.TSNE` to control
     the stopping criterion. By Santi Villalba.
     (`#5185 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/5186>`_)

   - Added optional parameter ``random_state`` in :class:`linear_model.Ridge`
     , to set the seed of the pseudo random generator used in ``sag`` solver. By `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.

   - Added optional parameter ``warm_start`` in
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression`. If set to True, the solvers
     ``lbfgs``, ``newton-cg`` and ``sag`` will be initialized with the
     coefficients computed in the previous fit. By `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.

   - Added ``sample_weight`` support to :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` for
     the ``lbfgs``, ``newton-cg``, and ``sag`` solvers. By `Valentin Stolbunov`_.
     Support added to the ``liblinear`` solver. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - Added optional parameter ``presort`` to :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`
     and :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`, keeping default behavior
     the same. This allows gradient boosters to turn off presorting when building
     deep trees or using sparse data. By `Jacob Schreiber`_.

API changes summary
-------------------
    - Attribute `data_min`, `data_max` and `data_range` in
      :class:`preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` are deprecated and won't be available
      from 0.19. Instead, the class now exposes `data_min_`, `data_max_`
      and `data_range_`. By `Giorgio Patrini`_.

    - All Scaler classes now have an `scale_` attribute, the feature-wise
      rescaling applied by their `transform` methods. The old attribute `std_`
      in :class:`preprocessing.StandardScaler` is deprecated and superseded
      by `scale_`; it won't be available in 0.19. By `Giorgio Patrini`_.

    - :class:`svm.SVC`` and :class:`svm.NuSVC` now have an ``decision_function_shape``
      parameter to make their decision function of shape ``(n_samples, n_classes)``
      by setting ``decision_function_shape='ovr'``. This will be the default behavior
      starting in 0.19. By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

    - Passing 1D data arrays as input to estimators is now deprecated as it
      caused confusion in how the array elements should be interpreted
      as features or as samples. All data arrays are now expected
      to be explicitly shaped ``(n_samples, n_features)``.
      By `Vighnesh Birodkar`_.

    - :class:`lda.LDA` and :class:`qda.QDA` have been moved to
      :class:`discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis` and
      :class:`discriminant_analysis.QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis`.

    - The ``store_covariance`` and ``tol`` parameters have been moved from
      the fit method to the constructor in
      :class:`discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis` and the
      ``store_covariances`` and ``tol`` parameters have been moved from the
      fit method to the constructor in
      :class:`discriminant_analysis.QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis`.

    - Models inheriting from ``_LearntSelectorMixin`` will no longer support the
      transform methods. (i.e,  RandomForests, GradientBoosting, LogisticRegression,
      DecisionTrees, SVMs and SGD related models). Wrap these models around the
      metatransfomer :class:`feature_selection.SelectFromModel` to remove
      features (according to `coefs_` or `feature_importances_`)
      which are below a certain threshold value instead.

    - :class:`cluster.KMeans` re-runs cluster-assignments in case of non-convergence,
      to ensure consistency of ``predict(X)`` and ``labels_``. By `Vighnesh Birodkar`_.

    - Classifier and Regressor models are now tagged as such using the
      ``_estimator_type`` attribute.

    - Cross-validation iterators always provide indices into training and test set,
      not boolean masks.

    - The ``decision_function`` on all regressors was deprecated and will be
      removed in 0.19.  Use ``predict`` instead.

    - :func:`datasets.load_lfw_pairs` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.19.
      Use :func:`datasets.fetch_lfw_pairs` instead.

    - The deprecated ``hmm`` module was removed.

    - The deprecated ``Bootstrap`` cross-validation iterator was removed.

    - The deprecated ``Ward`` and ``WardAgglomerative`` classes have been removed.
      Use :class:`clustering.AgglomerativeClustering` instead.

    - :func:`cross_validation.check_cv` is now a public function.

    - The property ``residues_`` of :class:`linear_model.LinearRegression` is deprecated
      and will be removed in 0.19.

    - The deprecated ``n_jobs`` parameter of :class:`linear_model.LinearRegression` has been moved
      to the constructor.

    - Removed deprecated ``class_weight`` parameter from :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier`'s ``fit``
      method. Use the construction parameter instead.

    - The deprecated support for the sequence of sequences (or list of lists) multilabel
      format was removed. To convert to and from the supported binary
      indicator matrix format, use
      :class:`MultiLabelBinarizer <preprocessing.MultiLabelBinarizer>`.

    - The behavior of calling the ``inverse_transform`` method of ``Pipeline.pipeline`` will
      change in 0.19. It will no longer reshape one-dimensional input to two-dimensional input.

    - The deprecated attributes ``indicator_matrix_``, ``multilabel_`` and ``classes_`` of
      :class:`preprocessing.LabelBinarizer` were removed.

    - Using ``gamma=0`` in :class:`svm.SVC` and :class:`svm.SVR` to automatically set the
      gamma to ``1. / n_features`` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.19.
      Use ``gamma="auto"`` instead.

      ignored when a :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` is given as a base estimator or
      the base estimator doesn't have predict.

    - The function :func:`hierarchical.ward_tree` now returns the children in
      the same order for both the structured and unstructured versions. By
      `Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello`_.

    - :class:`feature_selection.RFECV` now correctly handles cases when
      ``step`` is not equal to 1. By `Nikolay Mayorov`_

    - The :class:`decomposition.PCA` now undoes whitening in its
      ``inverse_transform``. Also, its ``components_`` now always have unit
      length. By `Michael Eickenberg`_.

    - Fix incomplete download of the dataset when
      :func:`datasets.download_20newsgroups` is called. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

    - Various fixes to the Gaussian processes subpackage by Vincent Dubourg
      and Jan Hendrik Metzen.

    - Calling ``partial_fit`` with ``class_weight=='auto'`` throws an
      appropriate error message and suggests a work around.
      By `Danny Sullivan`_.

    - :class:`RBFSampler <kernel_approximation.RBFSampler>` with ``gamma=g``
      formerly approximated :func:`rbf_kernel <metrics.pairwise.rbf_kernel>`
      with ``gamma=g/2.``; the definition of ``gamma`` is now consistent,
      which may substantially change your results if you use a fixed value.
      (If you cross-validated over ``gamma``, it probably doesn't matter
      too much.) By `Dougal Sutherland`_.

    - Pipeline object delegate the ``classes_`` attribute to the underlying
      estimator. It allows, for instance, to make bagging of a pipeline object.
      By `Arnaud Joly`_

    - :class:`neighbors.NearestCentroid` now uses the median as the centroid
      when metric is set to ``manhattan``. It was using the mean before.
      By `Manoj Kumar`_

    - Fix numerical stability issues in :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier`
      and :class:`linear_model.SGDRegressor` by clipping large gradients and
      ensuring that weight decay rescaling is always positive (for large
      l2 regularization and large learning rate values).
      By `Olivier Grisel`_

    - When `compute_full_tree` is set to "auto", the full tree is
      built when n_clusters is high and is early stopped when n_clusters is
      low, while the behavior should be vice-versa in
      :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering` (and friends).
      This has been fixed By `Manoj Kumar`_

    - Fix lazy centering of data in :func:`linear_model.enet_path` and
      :func:`linear_model.lasso_path`. It was centered around one. It has
      been changed to be centered around the origin. By `Manoj Kumar`_

    - Fix handling of precomputed affinity matrices in
      :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering` when using connectivity
      constraints. By `Cathy Deng`_

    - Correct ``partial_fit`` handling of ``class_prior`` for
      :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB` and
      :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB`. By `Trevor Stephens`_.

    - Fixed a crash in :func:`metrics.precision_recall_fscore_support`
      when using unsorted ``labels`` in the multi-label setting.
      By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

    - Avoid skipping the first nearest neighbor in the methods ``radius_neighbors``,
      ``kneighbors``, ``kneighbors_graph`` and ``radius_neighbors_graph`` in
      :class:`sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` and family, when the query
      data is not the same as fit data. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

    - Fix log-density calculation in the :class:`mixture.GMM` with
      tied covariance. By `Will Dawson`_

    - Fixed a scaling error in :class:`feature_selection.SelectFdr`
      where a factor ``n_features`` was missing. By `Andrew Tulloch`_

    - Fix zero division in :class:`neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor` and related
      classes when using distance weighting and having identical data points.
      By `Garret-R <https://github.com/Garrett-R>`_.

    - Fixed round off errors with non positive-definite covariance matrices
      in GMM. By `Alexis Mignon`_.

    - Fixed a error in the computation of conditional probabilities in
      :class:`naive_bayes.BernoulliNB`. By Hanna Wallach.

    - Make the method ``radius_neighbors`` of
      :class:`neighbors.NearestNeighbors` return the samples lying on the
      boundary for ``algorithm='brute'``. By `Yan Yi`_.

    - Flip sign of ``dual_coef_`` of :class:`svm.SVC`
      to make it consistent with the documentation and
      ``decision_function``. By Artem Sobolev.

    - Fixed handling of ties in :class:`isotonic.IsotonicRegression`.
      We now use the weighted average of targets (secondary method). By
      `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_ and `Michael Bommarito <http://bommaritollc.com/>`_.

API changes summary
-------------------

    - :class:`GridSearchCV <grid_search.GridSearchCV>` and
      :func:`cross_val_score <cross_validation.cross_val_score>` and other
      meta-estimators don't convert pandas DataFrames into arrays any more,
      allowing DataFrame specific operations in custom estimators.

    - :func:`multiclass.fit_ovr`, :func:`multiclass.predict_ovr`,
      :func:`predict_proba_ovr`,
      :func:`multiclass.fit_ovo`, :func:`multiclass.predict_ovo`,
      :func:`multiclass.fit_ecoc` and :func:`multiclass.predict_ecoc`
      are deprecated. Use the underlying estimators instead.

    - Nearest neighbors estimators used to take arbitrary keyword arguments
      and pass these to their distance metric. This will no longer be supported
      in scikit-learn 0.18; use the ``metric_params`` argument instead.

    - `n_jobs` parameter of the fit method shifted to the constructor of the
       LinearRegression class.

    - The ``predict_proba`` method of :class:`multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`
      now returns two probabilities per sample in the multiclass case; this
      is consistent with other estimators and with the method's documentation,
      but previous versions accidentally returned only the positive
      probability. Fixed by Will Lamond and `Lars Buitinck`_.

    - Change default value of precompute in :class:`ElasticNet` and :class:`Lasso`
      to False. Setting precompute to "auto" was found to be slower when
      n_samples > n_features since the computation of the Gram matrix is
      computationally expensive and outweighs the benefit of fitting the Gram
      for just one alpha.
      ``precompute="auto"`` is now deprecated and will be removed in 0.18
      By `Manoj Kumar`_.

    - Expose ``positive`` option in :func:`linear_model.enet_path` and
      :func:`linear_model.enet_path` which constrains coefficients to be
      positive. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

    - Users should now supply an explicit ``average`` parameter to
      :func:`sklearn.metrics.f1_score`, :func:`sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score`,
      :func:`sklearn.metrics.recall_score` and
      :func:`sklearn.metrics.precision_score` when performing multiclass
      or multilabel (i.e. not binary) classification. By `Joel Nothman`_.

    - `scoring` parameter for cross validation now accepts `'f1_micro'`,
      `'f1_macro'` or `'f1_weighted'`. `'f1'` is now for binary classification
      only. Similar changes apply to `'precision'` and `'recall'`.
      By `Joel Nothman`_.

    - The ``fit_intercept``, ``normalize`` and ``return_models`` parameters in
      :func:`linear_model.enet_path` and :func:`linear_model.lasso_path` have
      been removed. They were deprecated since 0.14

    - From now onwards, all estimators will uniformly raise ``NotFittedError``
      (:class:`utils.validation.NotFittedError`), when any of the ``predict``
      like methods are called before the model is fit. By `Raghav R V`_.

    - Input data validation was refactored for more consistent input
      validation. The ``check_arrays`` function was replaced by ``check_array``
      and ``check_X_y``. By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

    - Allow ``X=None`` in the methods ``radius_neighbors``, ``kneighbors``,
      ``kneighbors_graph`` and ``radius_neighbors_graph`` in
      :class:`sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` and family. If set to None,
      then for every sample this avoids setting the sample itself as the
      first nearest neighbor. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

    - Add parameter ``include_self`` in :func:`neighbors.kneighbors_graph`
      and :func:`neighbors.radius_neighbors_graph` which has to be explicitly
      set by the user. If set to True, then the sample itself is considered
      as the first nearest neighbor.

    - `thresh` parameter is deprecated in favor of new `tol` parameter in
      :class:`GMM`, :class:`DPGMM` and :class:`VBGMM`. See `Enhancements`
      section for details. By `HervÃ© Bredin`_.

    - Estimators will treat input with dtype object as numeric when possible.
      By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_

    - Estimators now raise `ValueError` consistently when fitted on empty
      data (less than 1 sample or less than 1 feature for 2D input).
      By `Olivier Grisel`_.


    - The ``shuffle`` option of :class:`.linear_model.SGDClassifier`,
      :class:`linear_model.SGDRegressor`, :class:`linear_model.Perceptron`,
      :class:`linear_model.PassiveAgressiveClassifier` and
      :class:`linear_model.PassiveAgressiveRegressor` now defaults to ``True``.

    - :class:`cluster.DBSCAN` now uses a deterministic initialization. The
      `random_state` parameter is deprecated. By `Erich Schubert`_.

   - Memory improvements of decision trees, by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Decision trees can now be built in best-first manner by using ``max_leaf_nodes``
     as the stopping criteria. Refactored the tree code to use either a
     stack or a priority queue for tree building.
     By `Peter Prettenhofer`_ and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Decision trees can now be fitted on fortran- and c-style arrays, and
     non-continuous arrays without the need to make a copy.
     If the input array has a different dtype than ``np.float32``, a fortran-
     style copy will be made since fortran-style memory layout has speed
     advantages. By `Peter Prettenhofer`_ and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Speed improvement of regression trees by optimizing the
     the computation of the mean square error criterion. This lead
     to speed improvement of the tree, forest and gradient boosting tree
     modules. By `Arnaud Joly`_

   - The ``img_to_graph`` and ``grid_tograph`` functions in
     :mod:`sklearn.feature_extraction.image` now return ``np.ndarray``
     instead of ``np.matrix`` when ``return_as=np.ndarray``.  See the
     Notes section for more information on compatibility.

   - Changed the internal storage of decision trees to use a struct array.
     This fixed some small bugs, while improving code and providing a small
     speed gain. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Reduce memory usage and overhead when fitting and predicting with forests
     of randomized trees in parallel with ``n_jobs != 1`` by leveraging new

     refactoring of the verbose code. By `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Faster :class:`sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTrees` by caching feature values.
     By `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Faster depth-based tree building algorithm such as decision tree,
     random forest, extra trees or gradient tree boosting (with depth based
     growing strategy) by avoiding trying to split on found constant features
     in the sample subset. By `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Add ``min_weight_fraction_leaf`` pre-pruning parameter to tree-based
     methods: the minimum weighted fraction of the input samples required to be
     at a leaf node. By `Noel Dawe`_.

   - Added predict method to :class:`cluster.AffinityPropagation` and
     :class:`cluster.MeanShift`, by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Vector and matrix multiplications have been optimised throughout the
     library by `Denis Engemann`_, and `Alexandre Gramfort`_.
     In particular, they should take less memory with older NumPy versions
     (prior to 1.7.2).

   - Precision-recall and ROC examples now use train_test_split, and have more
     explanation of why these metrics are useful. By `Kyle Kastner`_

   - The training algorithm for :class:`decomposition.NMF` is faster for
     sparse matrices and has much lower memory complexity, meaning it will
     scale up gracefully to large datasets. By `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Added svd_method option with default value to "randomized" to
     :class:`decomposition.FactorAnalysis` to save memory and
     significantly speedup computation by `Denis Engemann`_, and
     `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Changed :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedKFold` to try and
     preserve as much of the original ordering of samples as possible so as
     not to hide overfitting on datasets with a non-negligible level of
     samples dependency.
     By `Daniel Nouri`_ and `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Add multi-output support to :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcess`
     by John Novak.

   - Support for precomputed distance matrices in nearest neighbor estimators
     by `Robert Layton`_ and `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Norm computations optimized for NumPy 1.6 and later versions by
     `Lars Buitinck`_. In particular, the k-means algorithm no longer
     needs a temporary data structure the size of its input.

   - :class:`dummy.DummyClassifier` can now be used to predict a constant
     output value. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - :class:`dummy.DummyRegressor` has now a strategy parameter which allows

     output value. By `Maheshakya Wijewardena`_.

   - Multi-label classification output in multilabel indicator format
     is now supported by :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` and
     :func:`metrics.average_precision_score` by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Significant performance improvements (more than 100x speedup for
     large problems) in :class:`isotonic.IsotonicRegression` by
     `Andrew Tulloch`_.

   - Speed and memory usage improvements to the SGD algorithm for linear
     models: it now uses threads, not separate processes, when ``n_jobs>1``.
     By `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Grid search and cross validation allow NaNs in the input arrays so that
     preprocessors such as :class:`preprocessing.Imputer
     <preprocessing.Imputer>` can be trained within the cross validation loop,
     avoiding potentially skewed results.

   - Ridge regression can now deal with sample weights in feature space
     (only sample space until then). By `Michael Eickenberg`_.
     Both solutions are provided by the Cholesky solver.

   - Several classification and regression metrics now support weighted
     samples with the new ``sample_weight`` argument:

Bug fixes
.........

   - Fixed bug in :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning` :

     labels

   - Fixed a bug in :class:`LassoCV <linear_model.LassoCV>` and

     ``precompute="auto"`` and ``n_samples > n_features``. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - Fixed incorrect estimation of the degrees of freedom in
     :func:`feature_selection.f_regression` when variates are not centered.
     By `Virgile Fritsch`_.

   - Fixed a race condition in parallel processing with
     ``pre_dispatch != "all"`` (for instance, in ``cross_val_score``).
     By `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Raise error in :class:`cluster.FeatureAgglomeration` and
     :class:`cluster.WardAgglomeration` when no samples are given,
     rather than returning meaningless clustering.

   - Fixed bug in :class:`gradient_boosting.GradientBoostingRegressor` with
     ``loss='huber'``: ``gamma`` might have not been initialized.

   - Fixed feature importances as computed with a forest of randomized trees
     when fit with ``sample_weight != None`` and/or with ``bootstrap=True``.
     By `Gilles Louppe`_.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - :mod:`sklearn.hmm` is deprecated. Its removal is planned
     for the 0.17 release.

   - Use of :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelop` has now been removed after
     deprecation.
     Please use :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope` instead.

   - :class:`cluster.Ward` is deprecated. Use
     :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering` instead.

   - :class:`cluster.WardClustering` is deprecated. Use
   - :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering` instead.

   - :class:`cross_validation.Bootstrap` is deprecated.
     :class:`cross_validation.KFold` or
     :class:`cross_validation.ShuffleSplit` are recommended instead.

   - Direct support for the sequence of sequences (or list of lists) multilabel
     format is deprecated. To convert to and from the supported binary
     indicator matrix format, use
     :class:`MultiLabelBinarizer <preprocessing.MultiLabelBinarizer>`.
     By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Add score method to :class:`PCA <decomposition.PCA>` following the model of
     probabilistic PCA and deprecate
     :class:`ProbabilisticPCA <decomposition.ProbabilisticPCA>` model whose
     score implementation is not correct. The computation now also exploits the
     matrix inversion lemma for faster computation. By `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - The score method of :class:`FactorAnalysis <decomposition.FactorAnalysis>`
     now returns the average log-likelihood of the samples. Use score_samples
     to get log-likelihood of each sample. By `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Generating boolean masks (the setting ``indices=False``)
     from cross-validation generators is deprecated.
     Support for masks will be removed in 0.17.
     The generators have produced arrays of indices by default since 0.10.
     By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - 1-d arrays containing strings with ``dtype=object`` (as used in Pandas)
     are now considered valid classification targets. This fixes a regression
     from version 0.13 in some classifiers. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Fix wrong ``explained_variance_ratio_`` attribute in
     :class:`RandomizedPCA <decomposition.RandomizedPCA>`.
     By `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Fit alphas for each ``l1_ratio`` instead of ``mean_l1_ratio`` in
     :class:`linear_model.ElasticNetCV` and :class:`linear_model.LassoCV`.
     This changes the shape of ``alphas_`` from ``(n_alphas,)`` to
     ``(n_l1_ratio, n_alphas)`` if the ``l1_ratio`` provided is a 1-D array like
     object of length greater than one.
     By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - Fix :class:`linear_model.ElasticNetCV` and :class:`linear_model.LassoCV`
     when fitting intercept and input data is sparse. The automatic grid
     of alphas was not computed correctly and the scaling with normalize
     was wrong. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - Fix wrong maximal number of features drawn (``max_features``) at each split
     for decision trees, random forests and gradient tree boosting.
     Previously, the count for the number of drawn features started only after
     one non constant features in the split. This bug fix will affect
     computational and generalization performance of those algorithms in the
     presence of constant features. To get back previous generalization
     performance, you should modify the value of ``max_features``.
     By `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fix wrong maximal number of features drawn (``max_features``) at each split
     for :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` and
     :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`. Previously, only non constant
     features in the split was counted as drawn. Now constant features are
     counted as drawn. Furthermore at least one feature must be non constant
     in order to make a valid split. This bug fix will affect
     computational and generalization performance of extra trees in the
     presence of constant features. To get back previous generalization
     performance, you should modify the value of ``max_features``.
     By `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fix :func:`utils.compute_class_weight` when ``class_weight=="auto"``.
     Previously it was broken for input of non-integer ``dtype`` and the
     weighted array that was returned was wrong. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - Fix :class:`cross_validation.Bootstrap` to return ``ValueError``
     when ``n_train + n_test > n``. By `Ronald Phlypo`_.

     :class:`linear_model.Ridge`, by @eickenberg and `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Fixed :mod:`sklearn.linear_model.stochastic_gradient.py` L2 regularization
     issue (minor practical significance).
     By `Norbert Crombach`_ and `Mathieu Blondel`_ .

     `Machine Learning Cheat Sheet (for scikit-learn)
     <http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.de/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html>`_
     to the documentation. See :ref:`Choosing the right estimator <ml_map>`.
     By `Jaques Grobler`_.

   - :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` and
     :func:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` now support the use of advanced

     See :ref:`scoring_parameter` for details. By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_
     and `Lars Buitinck`_.
     Passing a function from :mod:`sklearn.metrics` as ``score_func`` is
     deprecated.

   - Multi-label classification output is now supported by
     :func:`metrics.accuracy_score`, :func:`metrics.zero_one_loss`,
     :func:`metrics.f1_score`, :func:`metrics.fbeta_score`,
     :func:`metrics.classification_report`,
     :func:`metrics.precision_score` and :func:`metrics.recall_score`
     by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Speed and memory usage improvements in
     :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` and
     :class:`feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`,
     by Jochen WersdÃ¶rfer and Roman Sinayev.

   - The ``min_df`` parameter in
     :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` and
     :class:`feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`, which used to be 2,
     has been reset to 1 to avoid unpleasant surprises (empty vocabularies)
     for novice users who try it out on tiny document collections.
     A value of at least 2 is still recommended for practical use.

   - :class:`svm.LinearSVC`, :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` and
     :class:`linear_model.SGDRegressor` now have a ``sparsify`` method that
     converts their ``coef_`` into a sparse matrix, meaning stored models
     trained using these estimators can be made much more compact.

   - :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` now produces multiclass probability
     estimates when trained under log loss or modified Huber loss.

   - Hyperlinks to documentation in example code on the website by
     `Martin Luessi`_.

     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` and all derived ensemble estimators
     now supports percentage values. By `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Performance improvements in :class:`isotonic.IsotonicRegression` by
     `Nelle Varoquaux`_.

   - :func:`metrics.accuracy_score` has an option normalize to return
     the fraction or the number of correctly classified sample
     by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.log_loss` that computes log loss, aka cross-entropy
     loss. By Jochen WersdÃ¶rfer and `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - A bug that caused :class:`ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier`'s to output
     incorrect probabilities has been fixed.

   - Feature selectors now share a mixin providing consistent ``transform``,
     ``inverse_transform`` and ``get_support`` methods. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - A fitted :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` or
     :class:`grid_search.RandomizedSearchCV` can now generally be pickled.
     By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Refactored and vectorized implementation of :func:`metrics.roc_curve`
     and :func:`metrics.precision_recall_curve`. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - The new estimator :class:`sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD`
     performs dimensionality reduction using SVD on sparse matrices,
     and can be used for latent semantic analysis (LSA).
     By `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Added self-contained example of out-of-core learning on text data
     :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_plot_out_of_core_classification.py`.
     By `Eustache Diemert`_.

   - The default number of components for
     :class:`sklearn.decomposition.RandomizedPCA` is now correctly documented
     to be ``n_features``. This was the default behavior, so programs using it
     will continue to work as they did.

   - :class:`sklearn.cluster.KMeans` now fits several orders of magnitude
     faster on sparse data (the speedup depends on the sparsity). By
     `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Reduce memory footprint of FastICA by `Denis Engemann`_ and
     `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Verbose output in :mod:`sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting` now uses
     a column format and prints progress in decreasing frequency.
     It also shows the remaining time. By `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - :mod:`sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting` provides out-of-bag improvement
     :attr:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.oob_improvement_`
     rather than the OOB score for model selection. An example that shows
     how to use OOB estimates to select the number of trees was added.
     By `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Most metrics now support string labels for multiclass classification
     by `Arnaud Joly`_ and `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - New OrthogonalMatchingPursuitCV class by `Alexandre Gramfort`_
     and `Vlad Niculae`_.

   - Fixed a bug in :class:`sklearn.covariance.GraphLassoCV`: the
     'alphas' parameter now works as expected when given a list of
     values. By Philippe Gervais.

   - Fixed an important bug in :class:`sklearn.covariance.GraphLassoCV`
     that prevented all folds provided by a CV object to be used (only
     the first 3 were used). When providing a CV object, execution
     time may thus increase significantly compared to the previous
     version (bug results are correct now). By Philippe Gervais.

   - :class:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` and the :mod:`grid_search`
     module is now tested with multi-output data by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - :func:`datasets.make_multilabel_classification` can now return
     the output in label indicator multilabel format  by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - K-nearest neighbors, :class:`neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor`
     and :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor`,
     and radius neighbors, :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor` and
     :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier` support multioutput data
     by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Random state in LibSVM-based estimators (:class:`svm.SVC`, :class:`NuSVC`,
     :class:`OneClassSVM`, :class:`svm.SVR`, :class:`svm.NuSVR`) can now be
     controlled.  This is useful to ensure consistency in the probability
     estimates for the classifiers trained with ``probability=True``. By
     `Vlad Niculae`_.

   - Out-of-core learning support for discrete naive Bayes classifiers
     :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB` and
     :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB` by adding the ``partial_fit``
     method by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - New website design and navigation by `Gilles Louppe`_, `Nelle Varoquaux`_,
     Vincent Michel and `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - Improved documentation on :ref:`multi-class, multi-label and multi-output
     classification <multiclass>` by `Yannick Schwartz`_ and `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Better input and error handling in the :mod:`metrics` module by
     `Arnaud Joly`_ and `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Speed optimization of the :mod:`hmm` module by `Mikhail Korobov`_

   - Significant speed improvements for :class:`sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN`
     by `cleverless <https://github.com/cleverless>`_


API changes summary
-------------------

   - The :func:`auc_score` was renamed :func:`roc_auc_score`.

   - Testing scikit-learn with ``sklearn.test()`` is deprecated. Use
     ``nosetests sklearn`` from the command line.

   - Feature importances in :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`,
     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` and all derived ensemble estimators
     are now computed on the fly when accessing  the ``feature_importances_``
     attribute. Setting ``compute_importances=True`` is no longer required.
     By `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - :class:`linear_model.lasso_path` and
     :class:`linear_model.enet_path` can return its results in the same
     format as that of :class:`linear_model.lars_path`. This is done by
     setting the ``return_models`` parameter to ``False``. By
     `Jaques Grobler`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_

   - :class:`grid_search.IterGrid` was renamed to
     :class:`grid_search.ParameterGrid`.

   - Fixed bug in :class:`KFold` causing imperfect class balance in some
     cases. By `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and Tadej JaneÅ¾.

   - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` has been refactored, and a
     :class:`sklearn.neighbors.KDTree` has been
     added which shares the same interface.  The Ball Tree now works with
     a wide variety of distance metrics.  Both classes have many new
     methods, including single-tree and dual-tree queries, breadth-first
     and depth-first searching, and more advanced queries such as
     kernel density estimation and 2-point correlation functions.
     By `Jake Vanderplas`_

   - Support for scipy.spatial.cKDTree within neighbors queries has been
     removed, and the functionality replaced with the new :class:`KDTree`
     class.

   - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity` has been added, which performs
     efficient kernel density estimation with a variety of kernels.

   - :class:`sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA` now always returns output with
     ``n_components`` components, unless the new parameter ``remove_zero_eig``
     is set to ``True``. This new behavior is consistent with the way
     kernel PCA was always documented; previously, the removal of components
     with zero eigenvalues was tacitly performed on all data.

   - ``gcv_mode="auto"`` no longer tries to perform SVD on a densified
     sparse matrix in :class:`sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV`.

   - Sparse matrix support in :class:`sklearn.decomposition.RandomizedPCA`
     is now deprecated in favor of the new ``TruncatedSVD``.

   - :class:`cross_validation.KFold` and
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedKFold` now enforce `n_folds >= 2`
     otherwise a ``ValueError`` is raised. By `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - :func:`datasets.load_files`'s ``charset`` and ``charset_errors``
     parameters were renamed ``encoding`` and ``decode_errors``.

   - Attribute ``oob_score_`` in :class:`sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`
     and :class:`sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`
     is deprecated and has been replaced by ``oob_improvement_`` .

   - Attributes in OrthogonalMatchingPursuit have been deprecated
     (copy_X, Gram, ...) and precompute_gram renamed precompute
     for consistency. See #2224.

   - :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` now converts integer input
     to float, and raises a warning. Previously it rounded for dense integer
     input.

   - :class:`sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier` now has a
     ``decision_function`` method. This will return the distance of each
     sample from the decision boundary for each class, as long as the
     underlying estimators implement the ``decision_function`` method.
     By `Kyle Kastner`_.

   - Better input validation, warning on unexpected shapes for y.

Changelog
---------

   - :func:`metrics.zero_one_loss` (formerly ``metrics.zero_one``) now has
     option for normalized output that reports the fraction of
     misclassifications, rather than the raw number of misclassifications. By
     Kyle Beauchamp.

   - :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` and all derived ensemble models now
     support sample weighting, by `Noel Dawe`_  and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Speedup improvement when using bootstrap samples in forests of randomized
     trees, by `Peter Prettenhofer`_  and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - :class:`feature_selection.SelectPercentile` now breaks ties
     deterministically instead of returning all equally ranked features.

   - :class:`feature_selection.SelectKBest` and
     :class:`feature_selection.SelectPercentile` are more numerically stable
     since they use scores, rather than p-values, to rank results. This means
     that they might sometimes select different features than they did
     previously.

   - Ridge regression and ridge classification fitting with ``sparse_cg`` solver
     no longer has quadratic memory complexity, by `Lars Buitinck`_ and
     `Fabian Pedregosa`_.

   - Ridge regression and ridge classification now support a new fast solver
     called ``lsqr``, by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Speed up of :func:`metrics.precision_recall_curve` by Conrad Lee.

   - Added support for reading/writing svmlight files with pairwise
     preference attribute (qid in svmlight file format) in
     :func:`datasets.dump_svmlight_file` and
     :func:`datasets.load_svmlight_file` by `Fabian Pedregosa`_.

   - Faster and more robust :func:`metrics.confusion_matrix` and
     :ref:`clustering_evaluation` by Wei Li.

   - :func:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` now works with precomputed kernels
     and affinity matrices, by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - LARS algorithm made more numerically stable with heuristics to drop

     numerical noise becomes predominant, by `Gael Varoquaux`_.

   - Faster implementation of :func:`metrics.precision_recall_curve` by
     Conrad Lee.

   - New kernel :class:`metrics.chi2_kernel` by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_, often used
     in computer vision applications.

   - Fix of longstanding bug in :class:`naive_bayes.BernoulliNB` fixed by
     Shaun Jackman.

   - Implemented ``predict_proba`` in :class:`multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`,
     by Andrew Winterman.

   - Improve consistency in gradient boosting: estimators
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` and
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` use the estimator
     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` instead of the
     :class:`tree._tree.Tree` data structure by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fixed a floating point exception in the :ref:`decision trees <tree>`
     module, by Seberg.

   - Fix :func:`metrics.roc_curve` fails when y_true has only one class
     by Wei Li.

   - Add the :func:`metrics.mean_absolute_error` function which computes the
     mean absolute error. The :func:`metrics.mean_squared_error`,
     :func:`metrics.mean_absolute_error` and
     :func:`metrics.r2_score` metrics support multioutput by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fixed ``class_weight`` support in :class:`svm.LinearSVC` and
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_. The meaning
     of ``class_weight`` was reversed as erroneously higher weight meant less
     positives of a given class in earlier releases.

   - Improve narrative documentation and consistency in
     :mod:`sklearn.metrics` for regression and classification metrics
     by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fixed a bug in :class:`sklearn.svm.SVC` when using csr-matrices with
     unsorted indices by Xinfan Meng and `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - :class:`MiniBatchKMeans`: Add random reassignment of cluster centers
     with little observations attached to them, by `Gael Varoquaux`_.


API changes summary
-------------------
   - Renamed all occurrences of ``n_atoms`` to ``n_components`` for consistency.
     This applies to :class:`decomposition.DictionaryLearning`,
     :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning`,
     :func:`decomposition.dict_learning`, :func:`decomposition.dict_learning_online`.

   - Renamed all occurrences of ``max_iters`` to ``max_iter`` for consistency.
     This applies to :class:`semi_supervised.LabelPropagation` and
     :class:`semi_supervised.label_propagation.LabelSpreading`.

   - Renamed all occurrences of ``learn_rate`` to ``learning_rate`` for
     consistency in :class:`ensemble.BaseGradientBoosting` and
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`.

   - The module ``sklearn.linear_model.sparse`` is gone. Sparse matrix support
     was already integrated into the "regular" linear models.

   - :func:`sklearn.metrics.mean_square_error`, which incorrectly returned the
     accumulated error, was removed. Use ``mean_squared_error`` instead.

   - Passing ``class_weight`` parameters to ``fit`` methods is no longer
     supported. Pass them to estimator constructors instead.

   - GMMs no longer have ``decode`` and ``rvs`` methods. Use the ``score``,
     ``predict`` or ``sample`` methods instead.

   - The ``solver`` fit option in Ridge regression and classification is now
     deprecated and will be removed in v0.14. Use the constructor option
     instead.

   - :class:`feature_extraction.text.DictVectorizer` now returns sparse
     matrices in the CSR format, instead of COO.

   - Renamed ``k`` in :class:`cross_validation.KFold` and
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedKFold` to ``n_folds``, renamed
     ``n_bootstraps`` to ``n_iter`` in ``cross_validation.Bootstrap``.

   - Renamed all occurrences of ``n_iterations`` to ``n_iter`` for consistency.
     This applies to :class:`cross_validation.ShuffleSplit`,
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit`,
     :func:`utils.randomized_range_finder` and :func:`utils.randomized_svd`.

   - Replaced ``rho`` in :class:`linear_model.ElasticNet` and
     :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` by ``l1_ratio``. The ``rho`` parameter
     had different meanings; ``l1_ratio`` was introduced to avoid confusion.
     It has the same meaning as previously ``rho`` in
     :class:`linear_model.ElasticNet` and ``(1-rho)`` in
     :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier`.

   - :class:`linear_model.LassoLars` and :class:`linear_model.Lars` now
     store a list of paths in the case of multiple targets, rather than
     an array of paths.

   - The attribute ``gmm`` of :class:`hmm.GMMHMM` was renamed to ``gmm_``
     to adhere more strictly with the API.

   - :func:`cluster.spectral_embedding` was moved to
     :func:`manifold.spectral_embedding`.

   - Renamed ``eig_tol`` in :func:`manifold.spectral_embedding`,
     :class:`cluster.SpectralClustering` to ``eigen_tol``, renamed ``mode``
     to ``eigen_solver``.

   - Renamed ``mode`` in :func:`manifold.spectral_embedding` and
     :class:`cluster.SpectralClustering` to ``eigen_solver``.

   - ``classes_`` and ``n_classes_`` attributes of
     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` and all derived ensemble models are
     now flat in case of single output problems and nested in case of
     multi-output problems.

   - The ``estimators_`` attribute of
     :class:`ensemble.gradient_boosting.GradientBoostingRegressor` and
     :class:`ensemble.gradient_boosting.GradientBoostingClassifier` is now an
     array of :class:'tree.DecisionTreeRegressor'.

   - Renamed ``chunk_size`` to ``batch_size`` in
     :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning` and
     :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchSparsePCA` for consistency.

   - :class:`svm.SVC` and :class:`svm.NuSVC` now provide a ``classes_``
     attribute and support arbitrary dtypes for labels ``y``.
     Also, the dtype returned by ``predict`` now reflects the dtype of
     ``y`` during ``fit`` (used to be ``np.float``).

   - Changed default test_size in :func:`cross_validation.train_test_split`
     to None, added possibility to infer ``test_size`` from ``train_size`` in
     :class:`cross_validation.ShuffleSplit` and
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit`.

   - Renamed function :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one` to
     :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one_loss`. Be aware that the default behavior
     in :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one_loss` is different from
     :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one`: ``normalize=False`` is changed to
     ``normalize=True``.

   - Renamed function :func:`metrics.zero_one_score` to
     :func:`metrics.accuracy_score`.

   - :func:`datasets.make_circles` now has the same number of inner and outer points.

   - In the Naive Bayes classifiers, the ``class_prior`` parameter was moved
     from ``fit`` to ``__init__``.

Version 0.12
============

**September 4, 2012**

Changelog
---------

   - Various speed improvements of the :ref:`decision trees <tree>` module, by
     `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` and
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` now support feature subsampling
     via the ``max_features`` argument, by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Added Huber and Quantile loss functions to
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - :ref:`Decision trees <tree>` and :ref:`forests of randomized trees <forest>`
     now support multi-output classification and regression problems, by
     `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Added :class:`preprocessing.LabelEncoder`, a simple utility class to
     normalize labels or transform non-numerical labels, by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added the epsilon-insensitive loss and the ability to make probabilistic
     predictions with the modified huber loss in :ref:`sgd`, by
     `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added :ref:`multidimensional_scaling`, by Nelle Varoquaux.

   - SVMlight file format loader now detects compressed (gzip/bzip2) files and
     decompresses them on the fly, by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - SVMlight file format serializer now preserves double precision floating
     point values, by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - A common testing framework for all estimators was added, by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - Understandable error messages for estimators that do not accept
     sparse input by `Gael Varoquaux`_

   - Speedups in hierarchical clustering by `Gael Varoquaux`_. In
     particular building the tree now supports early stopping. This is
     useful when the number of clusters is not small compared to the
     number of samples.

   - Add MultiTaskLasso and MultiTaskElasticNet for joint feature selection,
     by `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.auc_score` and
     :func:`metrics.average_precision_score` convenience functions by `Andreas
     MÃ¼ller`_.

   - Improved sparse matrix support in the :ref:`feature_selection`

   - New word boundaries-aware character n-gram analyzer for the
     :ref:`text_feature_extraction` module by `@kernc`_.

   - Fixed bug in spectral clustering that led to single point clusters
     by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`, added an option to
     ignore infrequent words, ``min_df`` by  `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

     `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Fixes in :class:`decomposition.ProbabilisticPCA` score function by Wei Li.

   - Fixed feature importance computation in
     :ref:`gradient_boosting`.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - The old ``scikits.learn`` package has disappeared; all code should import
     from ``sklearn`` instead, which was introduced in 0.9.

   - In :func:`metrics.roc_curve`, the ``thresholds`` array is now returned
     with it's order reversed, in order to keep it consistent with the order
     of the returned ``fpr`` and ``tpr``.

   - In :class:`hmm` objects, like :class:`hmm.GaussianHMM`,
     :class:`hmm.MultinomialHMM`, etc., all parameters must be passed to the
     object when initialising it and not through ``fit``. Now ``fit`` will
     only accept the data as an input parameter.

   - For all SVM classes, a faulty behavior of ``gamma`` was fixed. Previously,
     the default gamma value was only computed the first time ``fit`` was called
     and then stored. It is now recalculated on every call to ``fit``.

   - All ``Base`` classes are now abstract meta classes so that they can not be
     instantiated.

   - :func:`cluster.ward_tree` now also returns the parent array. This is
     necessary for early-stopping in which case the tree is not
     completely built.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` the parameters
     ``min_n`` and ``max_n`` were joined to the parameter ``n_gram_range`` to
     enable grid-searching both at once.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`, words that appear
     only in one document are now ignored by default. To reproduce
     the previous behavior, set ``min_df=1``.

   - Fixed API inconsistency: :meth:`linear_model.SGDClassifier.predict_proba` now
     returns 2d array when fit on two classes.

   - Fixed API inconsistency: :meth:`discriminant_analysis.QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis.decision_function`
     and :meth:`discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.decision_function` now return 1d arrays
     when fit on two classes.

   - Grid of alphas used for fitting :class:`linear_model.LassoCV` and
     :class:`linear_model.ElasticNetCV` is now stored
     in the attribute ``alphas_`` rather than overriding the init parameter
     ``alphas``.

   - Linear models when alpha is estimated by cross-validation store
     the estimated value in the ``alpha_`` attribute rather than just
     ``alpha`` or ``best_alpha``.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` now supports
     :meth:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.staged_predict_proba`, and
     :meth:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.staged_predict`.

   - :class:`svm.sparse.SVC` and other sparse SVM classes are now deprecated.
     The all classes in the :ref:`svm` module now automatically select the
     sparse or dense representation base on the input.

   - All clustering algorithms now interpret the array ``X`` given to ``fit`` as
     input data, in particular :class:`cluster.SpectralClustering` and
     :class:`cluster.AffinityPropagation` which previously expected affinity matrices.

   - For clustering algorithms that take the desired number of clusters as a parameter,
     this parameter is now called ``n_clusters``.

Version 0.11
============

**May 7, 2012**

Changelog
---------

Highlights
.............

   - Gradient boosted regression trees (:ref:`gradient_boosting`)
     for classification and regression by `Peter Prettenhofer`_
     and `Scott White`_ .

   - Simple dict-based feature loader with support for categorical variables
     (:class:`feature_extraction.DictVectorizer`) by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Added Matthews correlation coefficient (:func:`metrics.matthews_corrcoef`)
     and added macro and micro average options to
     :func:`metrics.precision_score`, :func:`metrics.recall_score` and
     :func:`metrics.f1_score` by `Satrajit Ghosh`_.

   - :ref:`out_of_bag` of generalization error for :ref:`ensemble`
     by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - :ref:`randomized_l1`: Randomized sparse linear models for feature
     selection, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and `Gael Varoquaux`_

   - :ref:`label_propagation` for semi-supervised learning, by Clay
     Woolam. **Note** the semi-supervised API is still work in progress,
     and may change.

   - Added BIC/AIC model selection to classical :ref:`gmm` and unified
     the API with the remainder of scikit-learn, by `Bertrand Thirion`_

   - Added :class:`sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit`, which is
     a :class:`sklearn.cross_validation.ShuffleSplit` with balanced splits,
     by Yannick Schwartz.

   - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.NearestCentroid` classifier added, along with a
     ``shrink_threshold`` parameter, which implements **shrunken centroid
     classification**, by `Robert Layton`_.

Other changes
..............

   - Merged dense and sparse implementations of :ref:`sgd` module and
     exposed utility extension types for sequential
     datasets ``seq_dataset`` and weight vectors ``weight_vector``
     by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Added ``partial_fit`` (support for online/minibatch learning) and
     warm_start to the :ref:`sgd` module by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Dense and sparse implementations of :ref:`svm` classes and
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` merged by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Regressors can now be used as base estimator in the :ref:`multiclass`
     module by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added n_jobs option to :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`
     and :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_kernels` for parallel computation,
     by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - :ref:`k_means` can now be run in parallel, using the ``n_jobs`` argument
     to either :ref:`k_means` or :class:`KMeans`, by `Robert Layton`_.

   - Improved :ref:`cross_validation` and :ref:`grid_search` documentation
     and introduced the new :func:`cross_validation.train_test_split`
     helper function by `Olivier Grisel`_

   - :class:`svm.SVC` members ``coef_`` and ``intercept_`` changed sign for
     consistency with ``decision_function``; for ``kernel==linear``,
     ``coef_`` was fixed in the one-vs-one case, by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - Performance improvements to efficient leave-one-out cross-validated
     Ridge regression, esp. for the ``n_samples > n_features`` case, in
     :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV`, by Reuben Fletcher-Costin.

   - Refactoring and simplification of the :ref:`text_feature_extraction`
     API and fixed a bug that caused possible negative IDF,
     by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Beam pruning option in :class:`_BaseHMM` module has been removed since it
     is difficult to Cythonize. If you are interested in contributing a Cython
     version, you can use the python version in the git history as a reference.

   - Classes in :ref:`neighbors` now support arbitrary Minkowski metric for
     nearest neighbors searches. The metric can be specified by argument ``p``.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelop` is now deprecated - Please use :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope`
     instead.

   - ``NeighborsClassifier`` and ``NeighborsRegressor`` are gone in the module
     :ref:`neighbors`. Use the classes :class:`KNeighborsClassifier`,
     :class:`RadiusNeighborsClassifier`, :class:`KNeighborsRegressor`
     and/or :class:`RadiusNeighborsRegressor` instead.

   - Sparse classes in the :ref:`sgd` module are now deprecated.

   - In :class:`mixture.GMM`, :class:`mixture.DPGMM` and :class:`mixture.VBGMM`,
     parameters must be passed to an object when initialising it and not through
     ``fit``. Now ``fit`` will only accept the data as an input parameter.

   - methods ``rvs`` and ``decode`` in :class:`GMM` module are now deprecated.
     ``sample`` and ``score`` or ``predict`` should be used instead.

   - attribute ``_scores`` and ``_pvalues`` in univariate feature selection
     objects are now deprecated.
     ``scores_`` or ``pvalues_`` should be used instead.

   - In :class:`LogisticRegression`, :class:`LinearSVC`, :class:`SVC` and
     :class:`NuSVC`, the ``class_weight`` parameter is now an initialization
     parameter, not a parameter to fit. This makes grid searches
     over this parameter possible.

   - LFW ``data`` is now always shape ``(n_samples, n_features)`` to be
     consistent with the Olivetti faces dataset. Use ``images`` and
     ``pairs`` attribute to access the natural images shapes instead.

   - In :class:`svm.LinearSVC`, the meaning of the ``multi_class`` parameter
     changed.  Options now are ``'ovr'`` and ``'crammer_singer'``, with
     ``'ovr'`` being the default.  This does not change the default behavior
     but hopefully is less confusing.

   - Class :class:`feature_selection.text.Vectorizer` is deprecated and
     replaced by :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer`.

   - The preprocessor / analyzer nested structure for text feature
     extraction has been removed. All those features are
     now directly passed as flat constructor arguments
     to :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer` and
     :class:`feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer`, in particular the
     following parameters are now used:

       - ``analyzer`` can be ``'word'`` or ``'char'`` to switch the default
         analysis scheme, or use a specific python callable (as previously).

       - ``tokenizer`` and ``preprocessor`` have been introduced to make it
         still possible to customize those steps with the new API.

       - ``input`` explicitly control how to interpret the sequence passed to
         ``fit`` and ``predict``: filenames, file objects or direct (byte or
         Unicode) strings.

       - charset decoding is explicit and strict by default.

       - the ``vocabulary``, fitted or not is now stored in the
         ``vocabulary_`` attribute to be consistent with the project
         conventions.

   - Class :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer` now derives directly
     from :class:`feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer` to make grid
     search trivial.

   - methods ``rvs`` in :class:`_BaseHMM` module are now deprecated.
     ``sample`` should be used instead.

   - Beam pruning option in :class:`_BaseHMM` module is removed since it is
     difficult to be Cythonized. If you are interested, you can look in the
     history codes by git.

   - The SVMlight format loader now supports files with both zero-based and
     one-based column indices, since both occur "in the wild".

   - Arguments in class :class:`ShuffleSplit` are now consistent with
     :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`. Arguments ``test_fraction`` and
     ``train_fraction`` are deprecated and renamed to ``test_size`` and
     ``train_size`` and can accept both ``float`` and ``int``.

   - Arguments in class :class:`Bootstrap` are now consistent with
     :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`. Arguments ``n_test`` and
     ``n_train`` are deprecated and renamed to ``test_size`` and
     ``train_size`` and can accept both ``float`` and ``int``.

   - Argument ``p`` added to classes in :ref:`neighbors` to specify an
     arbitrary Minkowski metric for nearest neighbors searches.

     predict methods; Enhanced test time performance by converting model
     parameters to fortran-style arrays after fitting (only multi-class).

API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when upgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.9:

  - Some estimators that may overwrite their inputs to save memory previously
    had ``overwrite_`` parameters; these have been replaced with ``copy_``
    parameters with exactly the opposite meaning.

    This particularly affects some of the estimators in :mod:`linear_model`.
    The default behavior is still to copy everything passed in.

  - The SVMlight dataset loader :func:`sklearn.datasets.load_svmlight_file` no
    longer supports loading two files at once; use ``load_svmlight_files``
    instead. Also, the (unused) ``buffer_mb`` parameter is gone.

  - Sparse estimators in the :ref:`sgd` module use dense parameter vector
    ``coef_`` instead of ``sparse_coef_``. This significantly improves
    test time performance.

  - The :ref:`covariance` module now has a robust estimator of
    covariance, the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator.

  - Cluster evaluation metrics in :mod:`metrics.cluster` have been refactored
    but the changes are backwards compatible. They have been moved to the
    :mod:`metrics.cluster.supervised`, along with
    :mod:`metrics.cluster.unsupervised` which contains the Silhouette
    Coefficient.

  - The ``permutation_test_score`` function now behaves the same way as
    ``cross_val_score`` (i.e. uses the mean score across the folds.)

  - Cross Validation generators now use integer indices (``indices=True``)
    by default instead of boolean masks. This make it more intuitive to
    use with sparse matrix data.

  - The functions used for sparse coding, ``sparse_encode`` and
    ``sparse_encode_parallel`` have been combined into
    :func:`sklearn.decomposition.sparse_encode`, and the shapes of the arrays
    have been transposed for consistency with the matrix factorization setting,
    as opposed to the regression setting.

  - Fixed an off-by-one error in the SVMlight/LibSVM file format handling;
    files generated using :func:`sklearn.datasets.dump_svmlight_file` should be
    re-generated. (They should continue to work, but accidentally had one
    extra column of zeros prepended.)

  - ``BaseDictionaryLearning`` class replaced by ``SparseCodingMixin``.

  - :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.fast_svd` has been renamed
    :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.randomized_svd` and the default
    oversampling is now fixed to 10 additional random vectors instead
    of doubling the number of components to extract. The new behavior
    follows the reference paper.

API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when upgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.8:

  - The ``scikits.learn`` package was renamed ``sklearn``. There is
    still a ``scikits.learn`` package alias for backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance, under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bscikits.learn\b/sklearn/g'

  - Estimators no longer accept model parameters as ``fit`` arguments:
    instead all parameters must be only be passed as constructor
    arguments or using the now public ``set_params`` method inherited
    from :class:`base.BaseEstimator`.

    Some estimators can still accept keyword arguments on the ``fit``
    but this is restricted to data-dependent values (e.g. a Gram matrix
    or an affinity matrix that are precomputed from the ``X`` data matrix.

  - The ``cross_val`` package has been renamed to ``cross_validation``
    although there is also a ``cross_val`` package alias in place for
    backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance, under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bcross_val\b/cross_validation/g'

  - The ``score_func`` argument of the
    ``sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score`` function is now expected
    to accept ``y_test`` and ``y_predicted`` as only arguments for
    classification and regression tasks or ``X_test`` for unsupervised
    estimators.

  - ``gamma`` parameter for support vector machine algorithms is set
    to ``1 / n_features`` by default, instead of ``1 / n_samples``.

  - The ``sklearn.hmm`` has been marked as orphaned: it will be removed
    from scikit-learn in version 0.11 unless someone steps up to
    contribute documentation, examples and fix lurking numerical
    stability issues.

  - ``sklearn.neighbors`` has been made into a submodule.  The two previously
    available estimators, ``NeighborsClassifier`` and ``NeighborsRegressor``
    have been marked as deprecated.  Their functionality has been divided
    among five new classes: ``NearestNeighbors`` for unsupervised neighbors
    searches, ``KNeighborsClassifier`` & ``RadiusNeighborsClassifier``
    for supervised classification problems, and ``KNeighborsRegressor``
    & ``RadiusNeighborsRegressor`` for supervised regression problems.

  - ``sklearn.ball_tree.BallTree`` has been moved to
    ``sklearn.neighbors.BallTree``.  Using the former will generate a warning.

  - ``sklearn.linear_model.LARS()`` and related classes (LassoLARS,
    LassoLARSCV, etc.) have been renamed to
    ``sklearn.linear_model.Lars()``.

  - All distance metrics and kernels in ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise`` now have a Y
    parameter, which by default is None. If not given, the result is the distance
    (or kernel similarity) between each sample in Y. If given, the result is the
    pairwise distance (or kernel similarity) between samples in X to Y.

  - ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise.l1_distance`` is now called ``manhattan_distance``,
    and by default returns the pairwise distance. For the component wise distance,
    set the parameter ``sum_over_features`` to ``False``.

Backward compatibility package aliases and other deprecated classes and
functions will be removed in version 0.11.

.. _changes_0_6:

Version 0.6
===========

**December 21, 2010**

scikit-learn 0.6 was released on December 2010. It is marked by the
inclusion of several new modules and a general renaming of old
ones. It is also marked by the inclusion of new example, including
applications to real-world datasets.


Changelog
---------

  - New `stochastic gradient
    <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html>`_ descent
    module by Peter Prettenhofer. The module comes with complete
    documentation and examples.

  - Improved svm module: memory consumption has been reduced by 50%,
    heuristic to automatically set class weights, possibility to
    assign weights to samples (see
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_svm_plot_weighted_samples.py` for an example).

  - New :ref:`gaussian_process` module by Vincent Dubourg. This module
    also has great documentation and some very neat examples. See
    example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_regression.py or
    example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_probabilistic_classification_after_regression.py
    for a taste of what can be done.

  - It is now possible to use liblinearâs Multi-class SVC (option
    multi_class in :class:`svm.LinearSVC`)

  - New features and performance improvements of text feature
    extraction.

  - Improved sparse matrix support, both in main classes
    (:class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV`) as in modules
    sklearn.svm.sparse and sklearn.linear_model.sparse.

  - Lots of cool new examples and a new section that uses real-world
    datasets was created. These include:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_face_recognition.py`,
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_plot_species_distribution_modeling.py`,
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_svm_gui.py`,
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_wikipedia_principal_eigenvector.py` and
    others.

  - Faster :ref:`least_angle_regression` algorithm. It is now 2x
    faster than the R version on worst case and up to 10x times faster
    on some cases.

  - Faster coordinate descent algorithm. In particular, the full path
    version of lasso (:func:`linear_model.lasso_path`) is more than
    200x times faster than before.

  - It is now possible to get probability estimates from a
    :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` model.

  - module renaming: the glm module has been renamed to linear_model,
    the gmm module has been included into the more general mixture
    model and the sgd module has been included in linear_model.

  - Lots of bug fixes and documentation improvements.

      complete `class reference
      <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html>`_.

Fixes
-----

    - API changes: adhere variable names to PEP-8, give more
      meaningful names.

    - Fixes for svm module to run on a shared memory context
      (multiprocessing).

    - It is again possible to generate latex (and thus PDF) from the
      sphinx docs.

Examples
--------

    - new examples using some of the mlcomp datasets:
      ``sphx_glr_auto_examples_mlcomp_sparse_document_classification.py`` (since removed) and
      :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`

    - Many more examples. `See here
      <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html>`_
      the full list of examples.


External dependencies
---------------------

    - Joblib is now a dependency of this package, although it is
      shipped with (sklearn.externals.joblib).

Removed modules
---------------

    - Module ann (Artificial Neural Networks) has been removed from
      the distribution. Users wanting this sort of algorithms should
      take a look into pybrain.

Misc
----

    - New sphinx theme for the web page.
