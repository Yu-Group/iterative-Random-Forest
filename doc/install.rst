Installing scikit-learn
=======================

.. note::

    If you wish to contribute to the project, it's recommended you
    :ref:`install the latest development version<install_bleeding_edge>`.


Installing the latest release
=============================

Scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= 2.6 or >= 3.3),
- NumPy (>= 1.6.1),
- SciPy (>= 0.9).

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip`` ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or ``conda``::

    conda install scikit-learn

**We don't recommend installing scipy or numpy using pip on Linux**,
as this will involve a lengthy build process with many dependencies.
Without careful configuration, building numpy yourself is likely to lead to an
installation that is much slower than it should be.
If you are using Linux, consider using your package manager to install
scikit-learn. It is usually the easiest way, but might not provide the newest
version.
If you haven't already installed numpy and scipy and can't install them via
your operating system, we recommended using a third-party distribution.

If you must install scikit-learn and its dependencies with pip, you can install
it as ``scikit-learn[alldeps]``. We strongly recommend against doing this
unless you are familiar with how to correctly build numpy and scipy. The most
common use case for this is in a ``requirements.txt`` file used as part of an
automated build process for a PaaS application or a Docker image. This option
is not intended for manual installation from the command line.

Third-party Distributions
==========================
If you don't already have a python installation with numpy and scipy, we
recommend to install either via your package manager or via a python bundle.
These come with numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib and many other helpful
scientific and data processing libraries.

Available options are:

Canopy and Anaconda for all supported platforms
-----------------------------------------------

`Canopy
<https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy>`_ and `Anaconda
<https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ both ship a recent
version of scikit-learn, in addition to a large set of scientific python
library for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

Anaconda offers scikit-learn as part of its free distribution.


.. warning::

    To upgrade or uninstall scikit-learn installed with Anaconda
    or ``conda`` you **should not use the pip command**. Instead:

    To upgrade ``scikit-learn``::

        conda update scikit-learn

    To uninstall ``scikit-learn``::

        conda remove scikit-learn

    Upgrading with ``pip install -U scikit-learn`` or uninstalling
    ``pip uninstall scikit-learn`` is likely fail to properly remove files
    installed by the ``conda`` command.

    pip upgrade and uninstall operations only work on packages installed
    via ``pip install``.


Python(x,y) for Windows
-----------------------

The `Python(x,y) <https://python-xy.github.io>`_ project distributes
scikit-learn as an additional plugin.


For installation instructions for particular operating systems or for compiling
the bleeding edge version, see the :ref:`advanced-installation`.
