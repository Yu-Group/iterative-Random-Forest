# Documentation for scikit-learn

This section contains the full manual and web page as displayed in
http://scikit-learn.org. To generate the full web page, including
the example gallery (this might take a while):

    make html

Or, if you'd rather not build the example gallery:

    make html-noplot

That should create all the doc in directory _build/html

To build the PDF manual, run

    make latexpdf


The website is hosted at github and can be updated manually (for releases)
by pushing to the https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.github.io repository.

It's recommended to run OptiPNG, before uploading the website.
The PNG files generated by Matplotlib tend to be ~20% too big, and they're
costing us bandwidth. You can run OptiPNG with::

    make optipng

# Development documentation automated build

A Rackspace cloud server named 'docbuilder' is continuously building the master branch
to update the http://scikit-learn.org/dev tree of the website.

The configuration of this server is managed at:

  https://github.com/scikit-learn/sklearn-docbuilder
