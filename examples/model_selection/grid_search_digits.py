============================================================
Parameter estimation using grid search with cross-validation
============================================================

This examples shows how a classifier is optimized by cross-validation,
which is done using the :class:`sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` object
on a development set that comprises only half of the available labeled data.

The performance of the selected hyper-parameters and trained model is
then measured on a dedicated evaluation set that was not used during
the model selection step.

More details on tools available for model selection can be found in the
sections on :ref:`cross_validation` and :ref:`grid_search`.
