=============================================================
Compare the effect of different scalers on data with outliers
=============================================================

Feature 0 (median income in a block) and feature 5 (number of households) of
the `California housing dataset
<http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html>`_ have very
different scales and contain some very large outliers. These two
characteristics lead to difficulties to visualize the data and, more
importantly, they can degrade the predictive performance of many machine
learning algorithms. Unscaled data can also slow down or even prevent the
convergence of many gradient-based estimators.

Indeed many estimators are designed with the assumption that each feature takes
values close to zero or more importantly that all features vary on comparable
scales. In particular, metric-based and gradient-based estimators often assume
approximately standardized data (centered features with unit variances). A
notable exception are decision tree-based estimators that are robust to
arbitrary scaling of the data.

This example uses different scalers, transformers, and normalizers to bring the
data within a pre-defined range.

Scalers are linear (or more precisely affine) transformers and differ from each
other in the way to estimate the parameters used to shift and scale each
feature.

``QuantileTransformer`` provides a non-linear transformation in which distances
between marginal outliers and inliers are shrunk.

Unlike the previous transformations, normalization refers to a per sample
transformation instead of a per feature transformation.

The following code is a bit verbose, feel free to jump directly to the analysis
of the results_.

# .. _results:
#
# Original data
# -------------
#
# Each transformation is plotted showing two transformed features, with the
# left plot showing the entire dataset, and the right zoomed-in to show the
# dataset without the marginal outliers. A large majority of the samples are
# compacted to a specific range, [0, 10] for the median income and [0, 6] for
# the number of households. Note that there are some marginal outliers (some
# blocks have more than 1200 households). Therefore, a specific pre-processing
# can be very beneficial depending of the application. In the following, we
# present some insights and behaviors of those pre-processing methods in the
# presence of marginal outliers.

make_plot(0)

#######################################################################
# StandardScaler
# --------------
#
# ``StandardScaler`` removes the mean and scales the data to unit variance.
# However, the outliers have an influence when computing the empirical mean and
# standard deviation which shrink the range of the feature values as shown in
# the left figure below. Note in particular that because the outliers on each
# feature have different magnitudes, the spread of the transformed data on
# each feature is very different: most of the data lie in the [-2, 4] range for
# the transformed median income feature while the same data is squeezed in the
# smaller [-0.2, 0.2] range for the transformed number of households.
#
# ``StandardScaler`` therefore cannot guarantee balanced feature scales in the
# presence of outliers.

make_plot(1)

##########################################################################
# MinMaxScaler
# ------------
#
# ``MinMaxScaler`` rescales the data set such that all feature values are in
# the range [0, 1] as shown in the right panel below. However, this scaling
# compress all inliers in the narrow range [0, 0.005] for the transformed
# number of households.
#
# As ``StandardScaler``, ``MinMaxScaler`` is very sensitive to the presence of
# outliers.

make_plot(2)

#############################################################################
# MaxAbsScaler
# ------------
#
# ``MaxAbsScaler`` differs from the previous scaler such that the absolute
# values are mapped in the range [0, 1]. On positive only data, this scaler
# behaves similarly to ``MinMaxScaler`` and therefore also suffers from the
# presence of large outliers.

make_plot(3)

##############################################################################
# RobustScaler
# ------------
#
# Unlike the previous scalers, the centering and scaling statistics of this
# scaler are based on percentiles and are therefore not influenced by a few
# number of very large marginal outliers. Consequently, the resulting range of
# the transformed feature values is larger than for the previous scalers and,
# more importantly, are approximately similar: for both features most of the
# transformed values lie in a [-2, 3] range as seen in the zoomed-in figure.
# Note that the outliers themselves are still present in the transformed data.
# If a separate outlier clipping is desirable, a non-linear transformation is
# required (see below).

make_plot(4)

###################################################################
# QuantileTransformer (uniform output)
# ------------------------------------
#
# ``QuantileTransformer`` applies a non-linear transformation such that the
# probability density function of each feature will be mapped to a uniform
# distribution. In this case, all the data will be mapped in the range [0, 1],
# even the outliers which cannot be distinguished anymore from the inliers.
#
# As ``RobustScaler``, ``QuantileTransformer`` is robust to outliers in the
# sense that adding or removing outliers in the training set will yield
# approximately the same transformation on held out data. But contrary to
# ``RobustScaler``, ``QuantileTransformer`` will also automatically collapse
# any outlier by setting them to the a priori defined range boundaries (0 and
# 1).

make_plot(5)

##############################################################################
# QuantileTransformer (Gaussian output)
# -------------------------------------
#
# ``QuantileTransformer`` has an additional ``output_distribution`` parameter
# allowing to match a Gaussian distribution instead of a uniform distribution.
# Note that this non-parametetric transformer introduces saturation artifacts
# for extreme values.

make_plot(6)

##############################################################################
# Normalizer
# ----------
#
# The ``Normalizer`` rescales the vector for each sample to have unit norm,
# independently of the distribution of the samples. It can be seen on both
# figures below where all samples are mapped onto the unit circle. In our
# example the two selected features have only positive values; therefore the
# transformed data only lie in the positive quadrant. This would not be the
# case if some original features had a mix of positive and negative values.
