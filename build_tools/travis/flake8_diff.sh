# This script is used in Travis to check that PRs do not add obvious
# flake8 violations. It relies on two things:
#   - find common ancestor between branch and
#     scikit-learn/scikit-learn remote
#   - run flake8 --diff on the diff between the branch and the common
#     ancestor
#
# Additional features:
#   - the line numbers in Travis match the local branch on the PR
#     author machine.
#   - ./build_tools/travis/flake8_diff.sh can be run locally for quick
#     turn-around
